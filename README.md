About
-----
"Mind Machines", per [Wikipedia][mind-machines]:

> A mind machine (aka brain machine or light and sound machine) uses pulsing
> rhythmic sound, flashing light, electrical or magnetic fields, or a
> combination of these, to alter the frequency of the user's brainwaves. Mind
> machines can induce deep states of relaxation, concentration, and in some
> cases altered states of consciousness, which have been compared to those
> obtained from meditation and shamanic exploration. Photic mind machines work
> with flickering lights embedded in sunglasses.

This app was inspired by [an article from _Make Magazine_][make].


Usage
-----
The app is hosted here:  
https://mind-machine.chris-allen-lane.com

1. Visit the app on a mobile device.
2. Tap the screen to enter "fullscreen" mode.
3. Insert the mobile device into a Google Cardboard (or equivalent) headset.
4. Assume a comfortable, meditative posture.

A session will last approximately 23 minutes.


Tips
----
1. For best results, use this application in a dark, quiet room. The fewer
   outside distractions you perceive, the better.
2. Use headphones.
3. Close your eyes. You'll be able to see the light pulses through closed
   eyelids. You may even want to turn your screen brightness down, because a
   bright screen will become uncomfortable once your eyes have become
   dark-adapted.


Safety
------
[WikiPedia][safety]:

> Rapidly flashing lights may be dangerous for people with photosensitive
> epilepsy or other nervous disorders. It is thought that one out of 10,000
> adults will experience a seizure while viewing such a device; about twice as
> many children will have a similar ill effect.
